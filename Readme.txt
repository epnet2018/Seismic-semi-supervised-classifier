Software package descriptionï¼š
----------------------------------------
The software package is the supporting code for the paper "Rapid Classification of Local Seismic Events based on Semi-Supervised Generative Deep"

In which:
The data directory contains the specific data samples used.
experiment_1-4.py are the corresponding codes for experiments 1-4 in the paper.
experiment_1-4 is the support file for the corresponding codes for experiments 1-4 in the paper, including pre-trained models, etc.
train.py is the output script for training models in the paper's methodology, while train_test.py is the validation script for newly generated models.
Due to GitHub's file size limitations, only the test dataset is uploaded in the data directory.

The code has been debugged on the Rtx 4090 24G Windows platform. If running on Linux, please modify the path separator from '/' to '\'.
